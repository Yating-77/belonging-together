        <h2>Foreword</h2>
        <p>
          Dear Parents:<br><br>
          Welcome to the "Belonging Together" parent support handbook. This handbook aims to help you better understand and support your child's daily needs through gentle scenarios.
          Every child is unique, and they may experience and perceive the world in different ways.
          <br><br>
          In this handbook, we provide practical strategies and advice through scenarios you might encounter in real life,
          helping you and your child face challenges in sleep, diet, social interaction, communication, emotional management, and sensory sensitivity.
          <br><br>
          We hope these scenario scenes can serve as a bridge of communication between you and your child, helping you create more moments of understanding, respect, and love.

        <h2>A Message to Parents</h2>
        <p>
          Each child is a unique universe. In their growth journey, there may be anxiety, sensitivity, or different ways of expression.
          <br><br>
          We hope these gentle scenarios can become a bridge of understanding and connection between you and your child.
          <br><br>
          May you feel trust, strength, and love in every moment of companionship.
